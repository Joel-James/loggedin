 * Plugin entry file.

 * Defines the path / file constants, loads the Composer autoloader,
 * loads the text domain, and hands off to {@see Core::instance()} to
 * boot every module in phased order.
 *
 * This file is intentionally minimal — the rule of thumb is "no
 * runtime logic in the bootstrap." Each subsystem (settings storage,
 * session guard, admin UI, REST API, Freemius) lives behind its own
 * class under `includes/` and registers its own hooks from there.
