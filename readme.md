## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### How can I set the limit, and where? ###
This plugin does not have a seperate settings page. But we have one configural settings to let you set the login limit.

1. Go to `Settings` page in admin dashboard.
2. Scroll down to see the option `Maximum Active Logins`.
3. Set the maximum number of active logins a user can have.

### Can I bypass this limit for certain users or roles? ###
Yes, of course. But this time you are going to add few lines of code. Don't worry. Just copy+paste this code in your theme's `functions.php` file or in custom plugin:

```php
function f_loggedin_bypass_users( $bypass, $user_id ) {
    
    // Enter the user IDs to bypass.
    $allowed_users = array( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 );

    return in_array( $user_id, $allowed_users );

}

add_filter( 'loggedin_bypass', 'f_loggedin_bypass_users', 10, 2 );
```

Or if you want to bypass this for certain roles:

```php
function f_loggedin_bypass_roles( $prevent, $user_id ) {

    // Array of roles to bypass.
    $allowed_roles = array( 'administrator', 'editor' );

    $user = get_user_by( 'id', $user_id );

    $roles = ! empty( $user->roles ) ? $user->roles : array();

    return ! empty( array_intersect( $roles, $allowed_roles ) );

}

add_filter( 'loggedin_bypass', 'f_loggedin_bypass_roles', 10, 2 );
```
