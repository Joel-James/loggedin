/**
 * Singleton trait.
 *
 * Every module class (`Core`, `Admin\Admin`, `Setup\Settings`,
 * `Front\Session_Guard`, etc.) is a singleton — there is one and only
 * one instance per request, accessed via `MyClass::instance()`. This
 * trait centralises the boilerplate so individual classes only have
 * to implement an `init()` method describing what to wire up when
 * they're first instantiated.
 *
 * Why singletons here:
 *   - Each module owns a slice of WordPress hooks. Instantiating it
 *     twice would register every hook twice, which silently doubles
 *     up callbacks (notices fire twice, REST routes register twice,
 *     etc.).
 *   - Tests can call `MyClass::instance()` repeatedly without having
 *     to thread instances around through fixtures.
 *
