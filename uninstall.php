 * state it would be in if the plugin had never been installed:
 *
 *   - Delete the unified settings option and the version marker.
 *   - Delete the legacy single-key options from pre-3.0 installs.
 *   - Delete the review-notice scheduling option and the per-user
 *     dismissal meta.
 *
 * We intentionally do NOT touch the `session_tokens` user meta — that
 * is core WordPress data, not ours; nuking it would log every user
 * out unnecessarily.
